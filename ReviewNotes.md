# Pingback v1 Review Notes

## Feature Implementation Summary

**v1 excludes cloud sync and custom templates; paywall and metadata reflect only shipped features; unlocks depend solely on active 'pro' entitlement via RevenueCat.**

## Centralized Feature System

### Feature Catalog (`pingback/Core/FeatureCatalog.swift`)
- **Single source of truth** for Free vs Pro features
- Defines exact feature set for v1 (no cloud sync, no custom templates)
- Provides feature descriptions for paywall rendering
- Includes App Store metadata text

### Feature Access Layer (`FeatureAccessLayer`)
- Centralized access control for all premium features
- Checks RevenueCat entitlements against feature catalog
- Handles free tier usage limits (10 reminders/month)
- Provides consistent API for feature gating across the app

## Free vs Pro Features (v1)

### Free Tier
- Up to 10 reminders/month
- Basic integrations: Messages, Mail, Safari share sheet
- Default reminder type only (fixed "Later today" option)
- Standard notifications (no quick actions / custom tones)
- Single-device use (no sync)

### Pro Tier
- Unlimited reminders
- All integrations: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Gmail, Outlook, Chrome share
- Smart scheduling: custom snooze times + recurring reminders
- Rich notifications: actionable buttons / quick reply / custom tones
- Themes & customization
- Priority support + early access to new integrations

## Implementation Changes

### Updated Components
1. **ProPaywallView** - Now renders features from `FeatureCatalog.proFeatureDescriptions`
2. **AddFollowUpView** - Uses `FeatureAccessLayer` for reminder limits and creation
